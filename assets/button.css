### 🔧 How to make the figure/table truly “live”

Each project page builds the figure and table from a **raw GitHub URL**. To use it:

1. Pick a canonical path in each repo (e.g., `results/figures/main_figure.png`, `results/tables/summary.csv`).
2. Ensure those files exist on your default branch.
3. Edit the `figure_path` and `table_path` variables at the top of each project page to your exact filenames.
4. On every push to the project repo, your website will render the newest assets on next site build.

> If you want the **site to rebuild automatically** when the project repos update, add a tiny GitHub Action in this website repo to run nightly or on push to those repos (can add later).

### ✅ Next quick edits for you

* Replace placeholder sentences under **Takeaway** blocks with your own two‑sentence summaries.
* Confirm the `figure_path` & `table_path` for each project.
* Drop `resume.pdf` and `cv.pdf` into `/resume/` and `/cv/` respectively.
* Commit & push: Quarto will render to `docs/` and GitHub Pages will update.

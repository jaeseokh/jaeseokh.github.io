## Featured Work

Below are three flagship projects that show how I extract value from messy, limited ag data, connect models to domain knowledge, and link farmer decisions to market risk.

::: {.grid .cards}
-   title: Enhancing Value from *Limited Data*
    href: projects/limited-data.qmd
    text: Bayesian & ML workflow that turns ~100 on‑farm field trials into actionable nitrogen/management insights. Includes evolution from early failed baselines (2021) to a signal‑rich, domain‑informed pipeline.

-   title: Farmers’ Seed & Fertilizer Choices under Risk
    href: projects/risk-choices.qmd
    text: Do farmers hedge? An empirical + simulation framework linking weather/price uncertainty to variety and N‑rate choices; connects farm decisions to ag‑commodity risk management.

-   title: Ongoing Projects
    href: projects/ongoing.qmd
    text: Active lines I’m exploring now (brief notes, figures, and open questions).

## What I Do (in one minute)

- **Model messy field data** → robust features from soils (SSURGO), topography (DEM), and weather (Daymet).  
- **Fit interpretable + predictive models** → XGBoost/QR forests + Bayesian partial pooling to handle limited/noisy trials.  
- **Bridge to decisions** → risk metrics, scenario analysis, and simple dashboards that stakeholders can use.

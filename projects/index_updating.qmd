## Work in Progress

### **1. The Value of Multiple OFPE Datasets as an Externality**

- **Main Contribution:**  
  Although current OFPE datasets are limited in both quantity and quality, this research progressively integrates *key domain knowledge* from crop growth models in agronomy and crop science. The goal is to reform traditional supervised learning models so they better align with the biological and economic mechanisms underlying yield response.

- **Objective:**  
  Combine more than 100 OFPE (On-Farm Precision Experiment) datasets and implement a leave-one-location-out (LOLO) cross-validation to predict yields for a held-out field *i* where no training data exist.

- **Models:**  
  XGBoost, Random Forest, and Causal Forest.

- **Key Findings / Limitations:**  
  1. The predictive capability of trained models remains low across fields.  
  2. A “universal yield-N response” derived from the combined dataset has limited explanatory power due to heterogeneous data quality and scale.

- **Ongoing Work:**  
  Shift focus from yield prediction toward improving the **expected information gain** and **probabilistic profitability**:  
  1. Identify available planting, application, and harvest windows.  
  2. Integrate core APSIM/DSSAT modules to simulate nitrogen uptake and mineralization processes.  
  3. Use ex-post yield and EONR (via backward induction) to evaluate stochastic profitability.

### **2. Profitable Seeding Decisions and Farmer Behavior**

- **Main Contribution:**  
  This study frames the *dynamic risk environment* faced by growers—capturing how weather and price volatility shape real-world decision-making and risk management behavior. It models how farmers adapt to uncertainty in both short- and long-term horizons.

- **Objective:**  
  Compare producers’ chosen seeding rates with the economically optimal seeding rate (EOSR) and assess their profitability under historical vs. recent weather and price conditions.

- **Model:**  
  Generalized Additive Model (GAM).

- **Key Findings:**  
  Producers’ chosen rates are strongly influenced by **historical weather** and **price trends**, but recent shocks in weather or market conditions often lead to suboptimal outcomes.

- **Ongoing Work:**  
  Develop a **dynamic framework** to evaluate how short- and long-term shocks in weather and prices affect producers’ adaptive decisions and profitability over time.

### **3. Enhancing the Value of Soil Information: Insights from OFPE**

- **Main Contribution:**  
  This research focuses on identifying strategies that help farmers enhance their **learning capacity**—both statistically and computationally—to improve long-run profitability through data-informed management decisions.

- **Status Quo:**  
  Farmers often base N-rate decisions on soil sampling and simulator-based recommendations. However, single-rate applications offer limited learning potential compared to variable-rate (VRN) approaches supported by on-farm experimentation (OFE).

- **Research Question:**  
  How effectively can we **learn accurate yield-N response functions** from soil information when combining VRN applications with OFE, compared to learning from single-rate applications?

- **Proposed Approach:**  
  Develop and test statistical frameworks (TBD) to quantify the **learning gain** from spatially rich OFE data relative to conventional soil-test-based recommendations.

    "text": "Hi, I’m Jaeseok Hwang, a Ph.D. candidate in Agricultural and Consumer Economics (ACE)  at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), with an expected graduation in May 2025. Over the past 5 years, I have gained extensive experience as a research assistant for the USDA NRCS-funded project, “Data Intensive Farm Management.” \nIn this role, I worked extensively with large-scale datasets, applying advanced data analytics and statistical techniques to address complex questions in farm management and productivity. During this time, I developed a deep expertise in designing and running machine-learning-based regression models to derive actionable insights from big data. My analytical toolkit includes a professional level of proficiency in R, which I use for most of my data processing, statistical modeling, and visualization tasks, as well as Python, which I employ as a versatile second option for complementary analysis and machine learning workflows.\nThis website highlights my research journey, showcasing programming code (R and Python via VS Code), summary of research outputs, and my individual research note reflecting my knowledge and skills."

    "text": "Work in Progress\n\n1. The Value of Multiple OFPE Datasets as an Externality\n\nMain Contribution:\nAlthough current OFPE datasets are limited in both quantity and quality, this research progressively integrates key domain knowledge from crop growth models in agronomy and crop science. The goal is to reform traditional supervised learning models so they better align with the biological and economic mechanisms underlying yield response.\nObjective:\nCombine more than 100 OFPE (On-Farm Precision Experiment) datasets and implement a leave-one-location-out (LOLO) cross-validation to predict yields for a held-out field i where no training data exist.\nModels:\nXGBoost, Random Forest, and Causal Forest.\nKey Findings / Limitations:\n\nThe predictive capability of trained models remains low across fields.\n\nA “universal yield-N response” derived from the combined dataset has limited explanatory power due to heterogeneous data quality and scale.\n\nOngoing Work:\nShift focus from yield prediction toward improving the expected information gain and probabilistic profitability:\n\nIdentify available planting, application, and harvest windows.\n\nIntegrate core APSIM/DSSAT modules to simulate nitrogen uptake and mineralization processes.\n\nUse ex-post yield and EONR (via backward induction) to evaluate stochastic profitability.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Profitable Seeding Decisions and Farmer Behavior\n\nMain Contribution:\nThis study frames the dynamic risk environment faced by growers—capturing how weather and price volatility shape real-world decision-making and risk management behavior. It models how farmers adapt to uncertainty in both short- and long-term horizons.\nObjective:\nCompare producers’ chosen seeding rates with the economically optimal seeding rate (EOSR) and assess their profitability under historical vs. recent weather and price conditions.\nModel:\nGeneralized Additive Model (GAM).\nKey Findings:\nProducers’ chosen rates are strongly influenced by historical weather and price trends, but recent shocks in weather or market conditions often lead to suboptimal outcomes.\nOngoing Work:\nDevelop a dynamic framework to evaluate how short- and long-term shocks in weather and prices affect producers’ adaptive decisions and profitability over time.\n\n\n\n\n3. Enhancing the Value of Soil Information: Insights from OFPE\n\nMain Contribution:\nThis research focuses on identifying strategies that help farmers enhance their learning capacity—both statistically and computationally—to improve long-run profitability through data-informed management decisions.\nStatus Quo:\nFarmers often base N-rate decisions on soil sampling and simulator-based recommendations. However, single-rate applications offer limited learning potential compared to variable-rate (VRN) approaches supported by on-farm experimentation (OFE).\nResearch Question:\nHow effectively can we learn accurate yield-N response functions from soil information when combining VRN applications with OFE, compared to learning from single-rate applications?\nProposed Approach:\nDevelop and test statistical frameworks (TBD) to quantify the learning gain from spatially rich OFE data relative to conventional soil-test-based recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Collaborative Work\n\nInforming Site-Specific Input Management in South Africa Using On-Farm Experimentation\n(with M. Delport, D. Bullock, and T. Mieno)\n    – Led data management, reproducibility workflows, and statistical analysis across all project sites."

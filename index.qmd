Hi, I'm **Jaeseok Hwang** — an **Applied Economist and Data Scientist** completing my Ph.D. in Applied Economics at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign** (expected May 2026).  

**My research develops** data-driven decision systems for U.S. crop producers, integrating applied machine learning, Bayesian modeling, and economic optimization to turn limited field data into actionable, risk-aware insights.  

**Main focus**  on building profit-optimization and risk-management frameworks that connect crop producers information with ag-technology, input-supply — using **R** as my primary analytical environment and **Python** for scalable machine-learning workflows.

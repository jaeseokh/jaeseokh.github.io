## Work in Progress

### **1. The Value of Multiple OFPE Datasets as an Externality**

- **Objective:**  
  Combine more than 100 OFPE (On-Farm Precision Experiment) datasets and implement a leave-one-location-out (LOLO) cross-validation to predict yields for a held-out field *i* where no training data exist.

- **Models:**  
  XGBoost, Random Forest, and Causal Forest.

- **Key Findings / Limitations:**  
  1. The predictive capability of trained models remains low across fields.  
  2. A “universal yield-N response” derived from the combined dataset has limited explanatory power due to heterogeneous data quality and scale.

- **Ongoing Work:**  
  Shift focus from yield prediction toward improving the **expected information gain** and **probabilistic profitability**:
  1. Identify available planting, application, and harvest windows.  
  2. Integrate core APSIM/DSSAT modules to simulate nitrogen uptake and mineralization processes.  
  3. Use ex-post yield and EONR (via backward induction) to evaluate stochastic profitability.

### **2. Profitable Seeding Decisions and Farmer Behavior**

- **Objective:**  
  Compare producers’ chosen seeding rates with the economically optimal seeding rate (EOSR) and assess their profitability under historical vs. recent weather and price conditions.

- **Model:**  
  Generalized Additive Model (GAM).

- **Key Findings:**  
  Producers’ chosen rates are strongly influenced by **historical weather** and **price trends**, but recent shocks in weather or market conditions often lead to suboptimal outcomes.

- **Ongoing Work:**  
  Develop a **dynamic framework** to evaluate how short- and long-term shocks in weather and prices affect producers’ adaptive decisions and profitability over time.

### **3. Enhancing the Value of Soil Information: Insights from OFPE**

- **Status Quo:**  
  Farmers often base N-rate decisions on soil sampling and simulator-based recommendations. However, single-rate applications offer limited learning potential compared to variable-rate (VRN) approaches supported by on-farm experimentation (OFE).

- **Research Question:**  
  How effectively can we **learn accurate yield-N response functions** from soil information when combining VRN applications with OFE, compared to learning from single-rate applications?

- **Proposed Approach:**  
  Develop and test statistical frameworks (TBD) to quantify the **learning gain** from spatially rich OFE data relative to conventional soil-test-based recommendations.

## Sample Data for Price Analysis

To analyze price changes in the stock and grain markets, we simulate datasets that reflect realistic time series data. Both datasets include a time trend and key market-specific factors.

---

### **1. Stock Market Price Analysis**

#### Sample Data
Variables include: <br>
- **Time ($t$)**: Monthly intervals over five years. <br>
- **Stock Price ($P_t$)**: Simulated closing prices of a hypothetical stock. <br> 
- **Earnings ($\text{Earnings}_t$)**: Quarterly corporate earnings. <br>
- **Market Sentiment ($\text{MarketSentiment}_t$)**: Sentiment score based on social media or news analysis. <br>
- **GDP Growth ($\text{GDPGrowth}_t$)**: Quarterly GDP growth rate. <br>
- **Interest Rate ($\text{InterestRate}_t$)**: Monthly changes in interest rates.

#### Regression Equation
$$
P_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Earnings}_t + \beta_2 \text{MarketSentiment}_t + \beta_3 \text{GDPGrowth}_t +  \beta_4 \text{InterestRate}_t + \beta_5 t + \epsilon_t
$$

### Interpretation
- $\beta_1$: Captures the sensitivity of stock price to earnings.
- $\beta_4$: Quantifies how changes in interest rates influence stock prices.

### **2. Corn Price Analysis**

#### Sample Data
Variables include: <br>
- **Time ($t$)**: Weekly intervals over five years. <br>
- **Corn Price ($P_t$)**: Simulated weekly prices. <br>
- **Yield ($\text{Yield}_t$)**: Estimated weekly yield. <br>
- **Export Demand ($\text{ExportDemand}_t$)**: Simulated export levels. <br>
- **Weather ($\text{Weather}_t$)**: Weekly precipitation and temperature  data. <br>
- **Seasonality ($\text{Seasonality}_t$)**: Binary indicator for planting and harvest periods. <br>

#### Regression Equation
$$
P_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Yield}_t + \beta_2 \text{ExportDemand}_t + \beta_3 \text{Weather}_t + \beta_4 \text{Seasonality}_t + \beta_5 t + \epsilon_t
$$

### Interpretation
- $\beta_1$: Reflects the sensitivity of corn price to changes in yield.
- $\beta_4$: Highlights the seasonal effects on price dynamics.

## Key Differences in Factors Driving Prices

### Stock Market
- Relies on economic indicators and company-specific factors.
- Speculative activities and market sentiment play significant roles.

### Grain Market
- Strongly influenced by weather, seasonal cycles, and agricultural policies.
- Prices are more inelastic due to food demand and supply shocks.

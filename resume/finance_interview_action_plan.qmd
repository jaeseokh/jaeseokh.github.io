## Objective

Secure interview opportunities within 30 days for risk/model validation-oriented finance roles, while producing defense-aligned portfolio outputs by April 5, 2026.

## Role Targeting (Primary)

- Model Risk Analyst / Model Validation Analyst
- Credit Risk Analytics Analyst
- Stress Testing / Portfolio Risk Analyst
- Quantitative Risk Researcher (validation and diagnostics focus)

## Positioning Statement

I build and validate decision models under non-stationarity, detect transferability failure early, and convert model diagnostics into risk-aware deployment decisions.

## Constraints and Strategy

- Constraint: Earliest start date is May 2026 (PhD completion).
- Constraint: Interview pipeline must be built immediately.
- Strategy: Prioritize interview conversion over breadth by using one flagship project as proof (`value_multifield_python`) and one supporting project for robustness narrative (`corn_seed_response`).

## 30-Day Interview Plan (Short-Term)

### Week 1 (Feb 18 - Feb 24): Assets and Message

- Finalize finance-targeted 1-page resume.
- Publish one flagship portfolio brief (2 pages) translating project findings to finance risk language:
  - Transferability risk
  - Out-of-group validation
  - Decision-loss proxy
  - Assumption audit and deployment criteria
- Prepare 6 interview stories (2 minutes each):
  - Model instability detection
  - Distribution shift diagnostics
  - Stress scenario design
  - Tradeoff: predictive gain vs governance clarity
  - Economic mechanism behind model failure
  - Communication under uncertainty
- Build target-company/contact tracker (application + outreach + follow-up cadence).

### Week 2 (Feb 25 - Mar 3): Pipeline Launch

Daily quotas (Mon-Sat):
- 10 tailored applications
- 15 recruiter/HR direct messages
- 5 hiring-manager messages
- 1 referral ask from alumni/lab/professional contacts

Follow-up rules:
- Follow-up #1 on day 4 after first message.
- Follow-up #2 on day 10.
- Stop after 2 follow-ups unless there is engagement.

### Week 3 (Mar 4 - Mar 10): Conversion Push

- Prioritize active threads only (companies that replied/clicked/requested info).
- Run mock interviews every day (45 to 60 minutes):
  - 20 min technical validation case
  - 20 min behavioral/communication
  - 10 min role-specific Q&A
- Build one concise "Model Validation Memo" sample (2 pages) to send on request.

### Week 4 (Mar 11 - Mar 17): Decision Window

- Double down on highest-response channels (likely direct outreach + targeted applications).
- Continue daily quotas with focus on conversion metrics:
  - Reply rate
  - Screening-call rate
  - Interview-invite rate
- Refine resume bullets and outreach scripts based on response data.

## Defense-Aligned Plan (Mar 18 - Apr 5)

Deliverables supporting both defense and interview credibility:

1. Portfolio Memo 1 (Flagship):
- "Model Transferability Failure Under Shifted Regimes"
- Include holdout diagnostics, decision-loss implications, and trigger thresholds.

2. Portfolio Memo 2 (Risk Design):
- "Stress Testing Framework for Decision Models Under Correlation and Volatility Shock"
- Include scenario design and monitoring logic.

3. Portfolio Memo 3 (Governance):
- "Model Lifecycle and Validation Checklist (SR 11-7 style logic, conceptual)"
- Focus on inventory, tiering, monitoring, challenger, escalation.

4. Defense Appendix:
- 1-page mapping from dissertation contributions to finance risk use-cases.

## 3-6 Month Specialist Track (Long-Term)

### Core Knowledge Build

- Credit risk framework: PD, LGD, EAD, expected vs unexpected loss.
- Governance framework: SR 11-7 principles and model lifecycle.
- Stress testing logic: scenario design, sensitivity, thresholds.
- Drift and stability monitoring: population shift and performance decay.

### Artifact Build

- One reusable validation template (Python/R + memo format).
- One challenger-model template with monitoring dashboard.
- One governance-ready documentation template (scope, assumptions, limitations, controls).

## Weekly Scoreboard (Non-Negotiable)

Track every Sunday:

- Applications sent
- Direct outreach sent
- Reply rate (\%)
- Screening calls booked
- Interviews booked
- Portfolio artifacts completed
- Defense milestones completed

## Risk Register and Mitigation

- Risk: Low response rate.
  - Mitigation: Increase direct outreach volume and tighten targeting.
- Risk: Profile mismatch due to domain background.
  - Mitigation: Lead with risk-validation methodology, not sector label.
- Risk: Time conflict with defense.
  - Mitigation: Use defense deliverables as interview portfolio artifacts.

## Operating Rule

Every week must produce:

- Interview pipeline progress (volume and conversion)
- One concrete portfolio artifact
- One defense milestone

No passive preparation weeks.

## Project Overview

This project explores robust methods to extract actionable agronomic insights from valuable but often limited On-Farm Experimentation (OFE) data, particularly focusing on understanding Nitrogen (N) management under real-world conditions.

## Progess of the project ( 2021 - 2025 )

**(2021) Initial Ambition: Predictive Power from OFE & ML**

* **The Goal:** The research began in 2021, aiming to leverage the power of Machine Learning ( ML adoption in agricultural research was accelerating at this moment) on 100 high-resolution On-Field Precision Experimental(OFPE) data. The goal was ambitious: train ensemble models XGBoost, Random Forest, and Causal Forest to predict yield response to Nitrogen (`yield ~ Nitrogen`) accurately enough for general recommendations on new, unseen fields.

* **The Reality Check:** The results were a crucial learning experience. Pooled models (both ML and standard fixed/random effects regression model) failed to capture the vital *within-field* yield variations (within-R² ≈ 0.01), despite explaining some *between-field* differences (Overall R² ≈ 0.6). Cross-validation was unstable, and prediction errors were high. 

* **The Core Insight (Gained over 3 years):** 
This hands-on experience led me to a fundamental conclusion: Achieving highly accurate, *generalizable* predictions for complex agronomic systems purely from data likely requires datasets orders of magnitude larger and richer than typically available (potentially demanding huge investment). 
 
The dominant site-specific effects and data limitations (quantity, quality of public soil/topo data) present a significant barrier for purely data-driven predictive approaches with current OFE scales and for individual crop producers.

**(Present) Pivot: From Prediction to Diagnosing Discrepancies**

* **The Challenge:** If direct, generalizable prediction is currently not feasible with N=100 fields, how can we still maximize the value of this rich OFPE data? How can researchers and farmers extract reliable insights locally?

* **My Current Focus:** This project pivots from prediction to **understanding and diagnosing**. The core idea is to intelligently integrate three information sources:

    1.  **Domain Knowledge (Prior):** Use established crop simulators (APSIM/DSSAT), parameterized with best available field data, to generate a science-based *prior expectation* of the `yield ~ N` response.

    2.  **OFE Data (Likelihood):** Use the real-world OFE observations to **update** and **correct** this prior expectation.

    3.  **Data-Driven Signals:** Adopt specific **weather timing variables** (e.g., `precip_15_post_N`, `max_dry_spell_S3`) from available data to represent key agronomic risks (leaching, drought stress) that might explain *why* the simulator differs from reality.

* **The Approach:** Employ a **Bayesian framework** (specifically Bayesian Hierarchical Models) to formally combine the simulator-based prior with the OFE data likelihood. The model focuses on explaining the **gap** ($Gap = Y_{OFE} - Y_{Simulator}$) and tests if our engineered **weather timing signals** can systematically account for this gap, potentially interacting with field characteristics.

## Key Contributions & Vision

1.  **Methodology for Limited Data:** This work demonstrates how combining process-based model priors (simulators) with observational data (OFE) and targeted feature engineering (timing signals) within a Bayesian framework can **enhance the informational value** extractable from limited datasets. It offers a path for robust inference and hypothesis testing even when purely data-driven predictive models struggle.
2.  **Empowering Local Learning & Diagnosis:** While large-scale AI tools aim for general prediction, errors inevitably occur at the field level. This framework provides a method for **local calibration and diagnosis**. By analyzing *why* a general model (like a simulator or future AI tool) deviates from local OFE results, and linking these deviations to specific conditions (weather timing, soil types), farmers and agronomists can gain deeper insights into their specific fields. It fosters a learning process where OFE data is used to intelligently adapt and interpret advanced knowledge for site-specific management, rather than just relying on black-box predictions.

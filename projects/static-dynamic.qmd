## Project Overview

This project investigates the sources of within-field yield variability observed in On-Farm Experimentation (OFE) data, specifically focusing on yield variations occurring at fixed Nitrogen (N) rates. The goal is to disentangle the contributions of static field characteristics (soil, topography) from the dynamic influence of weather timing events.

## Research Progression & Motivation

1.  **Initial Goal & Standard Approach:** Previous research aimed to model yield ($y_{ijk}$) using pooled data across ~100 OFE fields ($i$), subplots ($j$), and N rates ($k$), incorporating static field characteristics (Soil SS, Topography TP) and seasonal weather summaries ($W_i$). Standard econometric and ML models were used.

2.  **Observed Limitation:** These pooled models, while capturing *between-field* differences (Overall R² ≈ 0.6), critically failed to explain yield variations *within* fields (Within-R² ≈ 0.01). This highlighted that average effects of SS, TP, and simple weather metrics are insufficient to capture the site-specific and dynamic nature of the yield-N relationship. Public SSURGO/DEM data provided limited generalizable insights in this pooled context.

3.  **Refined Question - Focusing on Variability:** Given the challenges in modeling the mean response ($E[y|N]$) generalizeably, the research focus shifted to the second moment: **Why does yield vary so much among subplots receiving the *same* N rate within the *same* field?** ($Var(y_{ijk} | N_k, \text{Field}_i)$). Understanding this variability is key to assessing yield risk.

4.  **Proposed Pivot - Modeling Variability Directly:** Instead of modeling yield itself, this project directly models the **magnitude of within-treatment yield variability**. We quantify this for each N-rate cluster ($k$) within each field ($i$) using a robust metric like $V_{i,k} = \log(\text{sd}(y_{ijk}))$. This creates a new analytical dataset (N ≈ 400 field × N-rate units).

5.  **Intermediate Hypothesis & Anticipated Challenge:** A simple hypothesis is that $V_{i,k}$ is driven by the static heterogeneity within the N-rate zone ($H_{i,k}$ = metrics of SS/TP variation). However, given prior results, we expect $H_{i,k}$ alone will have limited explanatory power. We reason that the *impact* of static features is dynamic, critically dependent on weather conditions influencing soil N processes, water movement, and plant uptake.

6.  **Core Hypothesis - Weather Timing Signals Unlock Dynamic Relevance:** We hypothesize that specific **weather timing signals** ($W_i^{Timing}$ - e.g., `precip_15_post_N` for leaching risk, `max_dry_spell_S3` for drought stress) act as **modulators**. They interact with static heterogeneity ($H_{i,k}$). We propose that the **interaction term ($H_{i,k} \times W_i^{Timing}$)** is key to explaining $V_{i,k}$. The weather signal reveals *when* and *how* static SS/TP information becomes dynamically active, influencing N realization and yield variability. Testing this interaction is the core contribution.

7.  **Proposed Methodology:** Employ a **Linear Mixed-Effects Model (LMEM)** to model $V_{i,k}$. Fixed effects include $N_k$, $H_{i,k}$, $W_i^{Timing}$, and their interactions. Random effects for farm/field account for baseline differences.

## Key Contributions & Vision

1.  **Explaining Yield Risk:** Moves beyond mean yield prediction to directly model and decompose the drivers of within-field yield variability (risk) at specific N rates.
2.  **Quantifying Dynamic Interactions:** Provides a method to explicitly test and quantify how the impact of static field characteristics (soil, topography) on yield variability is modulated by specific, agronomically-relevant weather timing events.
3.  **Enhancing Static Data Value:** Demonstrates how integrating weather timing signals can potentially "unlock" the value of readily available but often poorly predictive static data (SSURGO, DEM) by revealing the conditions under which they become critical drivers of performance.
4.  **Informing Site-Specific Management:** By identifying key weather-landscape interactions that drive variability, this research provides foundational knowledge for developing more dynamic and adaptive site-specific risk management strategies.

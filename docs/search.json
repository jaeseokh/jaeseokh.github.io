    "text": "From Simple to Complex: The Journey Beyond Linear Regression\nLinear regression offers an intuitive framework for understanding relationships between predictors (independent variables) and responses (dependent variables). It simplifies the analysis by assuming a straight-line relationship, making it easy to interpret and apply. However, this simplicity often comes at the cost of ignoring the complexities and nuances of real-world data.\nTo perform higher-level analysis, it becomes necessary to relax the rigid assumptions of linear regression. The world is rarely governed by perfect linearity, and exploring the complexity in data requires breaking down these assumptions. This is where non-linearity and flexibility come into play."

    "section": "Introducing Flexibility: From Polynomials to Splines",
    "text": "Introducing Flexibility: From Polynomials to Splines\nNon-linear regression extends linear models by incorporating terms that account for curvature, such as polynomials. However, polynomials are limited by their global assumptions—they impose a rigid structure that may fail to adapt to local variations in the data.\nSplines provide a more flexible approach by dividing the predictor variable’s range into intervals and fitting piecewise polynomials within each segment. These are joined at “knots” to ensure smoothness. The spline regression equation can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_{it} &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{seed}_{it} + \\beta_2 \\text{nitrogen}_{it} + \\beta_3 \\text{precipitation}_{it} \\\\\n&\\quad + \\sum_{j=1}^k \\beta_j B_j(X_{it}) + \\epsilon_{it}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWhere:  - \\(B_j(X_{it})\\): Spline basis functions, defined as piecewise polynomials.  - \\(k\\): Number of basis functions or knots.  - \\(\\beta_j\\): Coefficients estimated for each basis function.  - \\(\\epsilon_{it}\\): Error term for panel observation \\(i\\) at time \\(t\\).\nThis flexibility enables splines to capture non-linear relationships while maintaining interpretability. However, even splines are parametric in nature, relying on pre-defined functions. To fully embrace complexity, we turn to non-parametric methods."

    "text": "The Need for Non-Parametric Methods\nNon-parametric methods go beyond predefined equations or functional forms, offering a data-driven approach to uncovering patterns. Unlike parametric models, which make assumptions about the underlying structure of the data, non-parametric models allow the data itself to dictate the relationships.\nIn contexts where the true relationship between variables is unknown or too complex for predefined models, non-parametric methods provide the flexibility needed to explore these intricacies. Kernel regression and locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) are examples of non-parametric approaches that adapt to the data without assuming a global functional form.\nThe move from parametric to non-parametric methods highlights the growing emphasis on flexibility and adaptability in statistical analysis."

A critical aspect of these methods is the training-test framework, which ensures that models generalize well to unseen data.\n\nTraining Set: Used to fit the model, estimating the parameters based on observed data.\nTest Set: Held out during training and used to evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data.\n\nThe training-test split addresses a key issue: overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model performs exceptionally well on the training data but fails to generalize to new observations. By testing on unseen data, we ensure that the model captures the underlying patterns without memorizing noise or outliers."

    "text": "Yield Response Modeling at the Single Field Level\n\nData Context\nIn a single field setting, we typically collect the following data:  - Yield (\\(Y\\)): Crop yield for each plot in the field  - Nitrogen (\\(N\\)): Nitrogen input  - Seed Rate (\\(S\\)): Seeding density  - Topographical Features: Elevation, slope, and aspect  - Soil Quality Metrics: Soil nutrition and water-storage capacity \nGiven the variability in field conditions and weather uncertainties, traditional parametric models may struggle to capture the yield response effectively.

    "text": "Expand model to Spatial and Time-Series analysis (regression)\nHaving explored yield response at the single-field level, we now extend the analysis to account for more complex real-world scenarios. These scenarios include multiple fields across different farms and states in the first year of experiments, as well as repeated experiments in single fields over multiple years. Finally, we consider panel data from multiple fields and multiple years to comprehensively model yield response to nitrogen.\n\n\nSpatial Regression: Accounting for Location-Based Variability\nIn the first year of the experiment, several fields were located across multiple farms and states. These fields exhibited spatial variability in yield response due to differences in soil quality, topography, and regional climate. A spatial regression model internalizes the impact of the spatial location of fields and the spatial autocorrelation structure of errors.\n\nSpatial Regression Model\nA commonly used spatial lag model (SLM) is expressed as:\n\\[ Y_i = \\rho W Y_i + X_i \\beta + \\epsilon_i \\]\nWhere:  - \\(Y_i\\) = Crop yield for field \\(i\\)  - \\(W\\) = Spatial weights matrix capturing the relationship between fields  - \\(\\rho\\) = Spatial autocorrelation coefficient  - \\(X_i\\) = Matrix of explanatory variables (e.g., nitrogen, soil quality, topography)  - \\(\\beta\\) = Coefficients for explanatory variables  - \\(\\epsilon_i\\) = Error term, assumed to be i.i.d. \nThe spatial weights matrix \\(W\\) defines the structure of spatial relationships, typically based on geographic distance or field adjacency.\nCite: Anselin (2013)\n\n\nExplanation of Spatial Autocorrelation\nSpatial regression models recognize that nearby fields are likely to have similar yields due to shared environmental conditions. This spatial autocorrelation structure mirrors the logic of time-series analysis, where observations are correlated over time.\n\n\n\n\nTime-Series Analysis: Capturing Temporal Dynamics\nThe logic behind time-series analysis is analogous to spatial models. Just as spatial models account for autocorrelation across fields, time-series models address autocorrelation over time. This approach is particularly relevant in single-field, multiple-year replicated experiments.\n\nTime-Series Regression Model\nAn autoregressive model (AR(1)) for yield response to nitrogen can be expressed as:\n\\[ Y_t = \\phi Y_{t-1} + X_t \\beta + \\epsilon_t \\]\nWhere:  - \\(Y_t\\) = Yield in year \\(t\\)  - \\(Y_{t-1}\\) = Yield in year \\(t-1\\) (lagged yield)  - \\(\\phi\\) = Autoregressive coefficient capturing temporal autocorrelation  - \\(X_t\\) = Matrix of explanatory variables (e.g., nitrogen, weather)  - \\(\\beta\\) = Coefficients for explanatory variables  - \\(\\epsilon_t\\) = Error term, assumed to follow \\(E[\\epsilon_t \\epsilon_{t-s}] = \\sigma^2\\) for \\(s = 0\\) and 0 otherwise\nCite: Enders (2008)\n\n\nExplanation of Temporal Autocorrelation\nTemporal autocorrelation arises when factors influencing yield (e.g., soil fertility, management practices) persist over time. Time-series models are essential for analyzing trends and year-over-year changes in yield response.\n\n\n\n\nPanel Data Analysis: Integrating Spatial and Temporal Dimensions\nOnce we have enough on-farm field experiment data collected across multiple fields and years, we can employ panel data analysis. Panel data regression incorporates both spatial and temporal dimensions, capturing time trends and spatial heterogeneity.\n\nPanel Data Regression Model\nA fixed-effects panel data model is expressed as:\n\\[ Y_{it} = \\alpha_i + \\delta_t + X_{it} \\beta + \\epsilon_{it} \\]\nWhere:  - \\(Y_{it}\\) = Yield for field \\(i\\) in year \\(t\\)  - \\(\\alpha_i\\) = Field-specific fixed effect capturing unobservable time-invariant characteristics  - \\(\\delta_t\\) = Year-specific fixed effect capturing time trends  - \\(X_{it}\\) = Matrix of explanatory variables for field \\(i\\) in year \\(t\\)  - \\(\\beta\\) = Coefficients for explanatory variables  - \\(\\epsilon_{it}\\) = Error term, assumed to be i.i.d.\n\n\nExplanation of Panel Data Strengths\nPanel data models allow us to:  1. Control for unobservable field-specific factors using \\(\\alpha_i\\).  2. Capture temporal effects like technological change or climate trends using \\(\\delta_t\\).  3. Improve estimation efficiency by leveraging variability across both fields and years. \n\n\n\n\nHandling Unbalanced Panel Data\nOn-farm field experiment data often present unbalanced panel structures. This imbalance arises because: - Fields differ in size, soil type, or management, leading to variability in the number of experimental plots per location (county or state level). - The number of experiments conducted each year may vary due to funding, weather conditions, or logistical constraints.\n\nChallenges of Unbalanced Panel Data\n\nMissing Observations: Some fields or years may lack data, creating gaps in the panel.\nHeterogeneity: Unequal representation of fields or years may introduce bias in parameter estimates if not properly accounted for.\nUneven Weights: Overrepresented fields or years may disproportionately influence regression results.\n\n\n\nRegression Model for Unbalanced Panel Data\nTo handle unbalanced panel data, we use a mixed-effects regression model. This model includes both fixed effects (to control for field- and time-specific factors) and random effects (to account for unobserved heterogeneity). The model can be written as:\n\\[ Y_{it} = \\alpha_i + \\delta_t + X_{it} \\beta + u_i + \\epsilon_{it} \\]\nWhere:  - \\(u_i\\) = Random effect for field \\(i\\), assumed to follow \\(u_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_u^2)\\)  - \\(\\epsilon_{it}\\) = Random error term, assumed to follow \\(\\epsilon_{it} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_\\epsilon^2)\\) \n\n\nWeighted Regression for Unbalanced Panels\nAn alternative approach is to apply weighted least squares (WLS) to give appropriate importance to underrepresented fields or years:\n\\[ \\text{minimize} \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{t=1}^T w_{it} \\left( Y_{it} - \\alpha_i - \\delta_t - X_{it} \\beta \\right)^2 \\]\nWhere:  - \\(w_{it}\\) = Weight for observation \\((i,t)\\), typically inversely proportional to the variance or frequency of observations.\nCite: Wooldridge (2019)\n\n\nImplementation Example: Mixed-Effects Model\nThe following R code demonstrates how to implement a mixed-effects model for unbalanced panel data:\n\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(lme4)\n\n# Generate synthetic unbalanced panel data\nset.seed(123)\nn &lt;- 15  # Number of fields\nt &lt;- 5   # Maximum number of years\nfields &lt;- rep(1:n, each = t)\nyears &lt;- rep(1:t, times = n)\nobserved &lt;- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), n * t, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.8, 0.2))  # Random missing data\nfields &lt;- fields[observed]\nyears &lt;- years[observed]\nnitrogen &lt;- runif(length(fields), 0, 200)\nfixed_effect &lt;- rep(rnorm(n, 50, 5), each = t)[observed]\nyield &lt;- fixed_effect + 0.8 * nitrogen + rnorm(length(fields), 0, 5)\ndata_unbalanced &lt;- data.frame(Field = factor(fields), Year = factor(years), Nitrogen = nitrogen, Yield = yield)\n\n# Fit a mixed-effects model\nmixed_model &lt;- lmer(Yield ~ Nitrogen + (1 | Field) + (1 | Year), data = data_unbalanced)\nsummary(mixed_model)\n\nLinear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod']\nFormula: Yield ~ Nitrogen + (1 | Field) + (1 | Year)\n   Data: data_unbalanced\n\nREML criterion at convergence: 361.9\n\nScaled residuals: \n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-2.06474 -0.66317 -0.02812  0.64895  1.75602 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups   Name        Variance Std.Dev.\n Field    (Intercept) 10.246   3.2009  \n Year     (Intercept)  0.574   0.7576  \n Residual             16.512   4.0635  \nNumber of obs: 60, groups:  Field, 15; Year, 5\n\nFixed effects:\n            Estimate Std.

The observed data (green dots) illustrate variability due to random error, while the red line represents the fitted Mitscherlich-Baule (M-B) function. This function effectively captures the diminishing returns to nitrogen and the asymptotic nature of yield, where yields plateau as nitrogen levels approach saturation.\nWhile the M-B production function is biologically intuitive, its parameters are nonlinear and require specialized estimation techniques, such as nonlinear least squares (as shown above). In practical applications, simpler functional forms, such as quadratic or quadratic plateau models, are often used for estimating yield response due to their ease of implementation within standard linear regression frameworks.\n\n\n\nTo estimate yield response to nitrogen using regression models, a common approach is to employ a quadratic or quadratic plateau model. These models approximate the nonlinear relationship between nitrogen and yield while maintaining the simplicity of linear regression.\n\n\nThe quadratic model assumes a concave relationship between nitrogen input and yield:\n\\[ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 N + \\beta_2 N^2 + \\epsilon \\]\nWhere:  - \\(Y\\) = Crop yield  - \\(N\\) = Nitrogen input  - \\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_1\\), \\(\\beta_2\\) = Model parameters  - \\(\\epsilon\\) = Error term\nThis model captures the diminishing returns to nitrogen through the quadratic term (\\(N^2\\)), with \\(\\beta_2 &lt; 0\\). It has been widely used in empirical studies of nitrogen response due to its simplicity and flexibility.\nCite: Lory and Scharf (2003)\n\n\n\nA variation of the quadratic model is the quadratic plateau model, which assumes that yields plateau after a certain level of nitrogen input:\n\\[ Y = \\begin{cases}\n\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 N + \\beta_2 N^2, & \\text{if } N &lt; N_{\\text{critical}} \\\\\nY_{\\text{max}}, & \\text{if } N \\geq N_{\\text{critical}}\n\\end{cases} \\]\nWhere:  - \\(N_{\\text{critical}}\\) = Critical nitrogen rate at which the yield plateaus  - \\(Y_{\\text{max}}\\) = Maximum attainable yield \nThis model incorporates biological realism similar to the M-B function but remains computationally simpler for estimation.\nCite: Cerrato and Blackmer (1990)\n\n\n\nTo estimate yield response using regression, we start with the quadratic model as a foundation.

The observed data (green dots) illustrate variability due to random error, while the red line represents the fitted Mitscherlich-Baule (M-B) function. This function effectively captures the diminishing returns to nitrogen and the asymptotic nature of yield, where yields plateau as nitrogen levels approach saturation.\nWhile the M-B production function is biologically intuitive, its parameters are nonlinear and require specialized estimation techniques, such as nonlinear least squares (as shown above). In practical applications, simpler functional forms, such as quadratic or quadratic plateau models, are often used for estimating yield response due to their ease of implementation within standard linear regression frameworks.\n\n\n\nTo estimate yield response to nitrogen using regression models, a common approach is to employ a quadratic or quadratic plateau model. These models approximate the nonlinear relationship between nitrogen and yield while maintaining the simplicity of linear regression.\n\n\nThe quadratic model assumes a concave relationship between nitrogen input and yield:\n\\[ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 N + \\beta_2 N^2 + \\epsilon \\]\nWhere:  - \\(Y\\) = Crop yield  - \\(N\\) = Nitrogen input  - \\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_1\\), \\(\\beta_2\\) = Model parameters  - \\(\\epsilon\\) = Error term\nThis model captures the diminishing returns to nitrogen through the quadratic term (\\(N^2\\)), with \\(\\beta_2 &lt; 0\\). It has been widely used in empirical studies of nitrogen response due to its simplicity and flexibility.\nCite: Lory and Scharf (2003)\n\n\n\nA variation of the quadratic model is the quadratic plateau model, which assumes that yields plateau after a certain level of nitrogen input:\n\\[ Y = \\begin{cases}\n\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 N + \\beta_2 N^2, & \\text{if } N &lt; N_{\\text{critical}} \\\\\nY_{\\text{max}}, & \\text{if } N \\geq N_{\\text{critical}}\n\\end{cases} \\]\nWhere:  - \\(N_{\\text{critical}}\\) = Critical nitrogen rate at which the yield plateaus  - \\(Y_{\\text{max}}\\) = Maximum attainable yield \nThis model incorporates biological realism similar to the M-B function but remains computationally simpler for estimation.\nCite: Cerrato and Blackmer (1990)\n\n\n\nTo estimate yield response using regression, we start with the quadratic model as a foundation.

These models provide a generalized framework for understanding the relationship between inputs and outputs in various industries. Similarly, crop production functions extend these concepts to the agricultural sector, focusing on crop response to specific inputs like nitrogen, water, and other environmental factors.\nCrop production functions share similarities with these famous production functions:  - Like the Cobb-Douglas function, they often assume diminishing marginal returns to inputs.  - Similar to the Leontief function, they may reflect constraints such as minimum requirements of critical inputs (e.g., water or nutrients).  - As in the CES function, some models allow for substitutability or complementarity between inputs, tailored to specific agricultural contexts. \nThis section explores crop production functions with a focus on corn, particularly the influential work of Just and Pope (1978) , which provided a framework for modeling crop yield as a function of inputs and environmental factors, accounting for variability and risk."

    "text": "Crop Yield Response Function to Nitrogen\nUnderstanding the yield response function to nitrogen is crucial because nitrogen is one of the most significant and manageable inputs in crop production. Optimizing nitrogen use is essential for balancing yield maximization with cost-efficiency and environmental sustainability. Crop yield response to nitrogen often follows a diminishing returns pattern, making it an ideal application of the production function concepts introduced earlier.\nThe Mitscherlich-Baule (M-B) production function provides a useful framework for modeling nitrogen response. Unlike the simplistic quadratic model, the M-B function accounts for diminishing returns as nitrogen input increases, with an asymptotic yield level. It can be expressed as:\n\\[ Y = Y_{\\text{max}} \\left(1 - e^{-\\beta N}\\right) \\]\nWhere:  - \\(Y\\) = Crop yield  - \\(Y_{\\text{max}}\\) = Maximum potential yield  - \\(\\beta\\) = Nitrogen efficiency parameter  - \\(N\\) = Nitrogen input\nCite: Cerrato and Blackmer (1990)\n\nConnection to Classical Production Functions\n\nCobb-Douglas:\n\nThe M-B function aligns conceptually with the Cobb-Douglas model, as both exhibit diminishing marginal returns. However, while Cobb-Douglas assumes constant elasticities, the M-B function allows elasticities to change with input levels, reflecting the unique biological response of crops to nitrogen.\n\nLeontief:\n\nThe M-B function can capture constraints on nitrogen use akin to the Leontief model when nitrogen is insufficient to reach the asymptotic yield, effectively making other inputs redundant.\n\nCES:\n\nThe M-B function can be extended to include interactions with other inputs, allowing for substitutability or complementarity between nitrogen and water, similar to the flexibility of the CES function.\n\n\nThe M-B production function thus bridges classical economic production functions and agricultural models by addressing the specific nonlinear response of crop yield to nitrogen. It provides a foundation for econometric modeling, enabling detailed analysis of yield response while capturing biological and environmental dynamics."

During this time, I developed a deep expertise in designing and running machine-learning-based regression models to derive actionable insights from big data. My analytical toolkit includes a professional level of proficiency in R, which I use for most of my data processing, statistical modeling, and visualization tasks, as well as Python, which I employ as a versatile second option for complementary analysis and machine learning workflows.\nThis website highlights my research journey, showcasing programming code (R and Python via VS Code), summary of research outputs, and my individual research note reflecting my knowledge and skills.",

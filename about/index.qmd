Hi, I'm Jaeseok Hwang, a Ph.D. candidate in Agricultural and Consumer Economics (ACE) <br> at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), with an expected graduation in May 2025. Over the past 5 years, I have gained extensive experience as a research assistant for the USDA NRCS-funded project, "Data Intensive Farm Management." <br> 

In this role, I worked extensively with large-scale datasets, applying advanced data analytics and statistical techniques to address complex questions in farm management and productivity. During this time, I developed a deep expertise in designing and running machine-learning-based regression models to derive actionable insights from big data. My analytical toolkit includes a professional level of proficiency in R, which I use for most of my data processing, statistical modeling, and visualization tasks, as well as Python, which I employ as a versatile second option for complementary analysis and machine learning workflows.

This website highlights my research journey, showcasing programming code (R and Python via VS Code), summary of research outputs, and my individual research note reflecting my knowledge and skills.
